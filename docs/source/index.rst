:Abstract:  AEON.to_ is a service that allows users to pay any bitcoin address
            anonymously using Aeon.
            .. Aeon_ is a secure, private, untraceable currency that is open-source
            .. and freely available to all.
            ..

            AEON.to_ converts Aeon provided by the user to bitcoins
            (BTC), which are sent to a given bitcoin address.

            AEON.to_ provides an API that enables developers to use the service
            in programs, apps, scripts etc. This API therefore allows developers
            to integrate an option to pay any bitcoin address in their product,
            for example, in a Aeon wallet service.
            The API is a REST-like API using `JSON` as data format. It is available anonymously
            and does not require identification or authentication.
            This document describes this API and gives examples of its usage.
